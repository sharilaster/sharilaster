I am currently the Government Information Librarian & Data Services Librarian at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Prior to moving to Santa Barbara, I was the Government Documents Librarian at the University of Akron. 

This site is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the minimalist theme [Lagrange](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/ "Lagrange, a minimalist Jekyll theme"), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I relied almost entirely on the [Programming Historian tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages "Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages") by Amanda Visconti for assembling and modifying this site.
