I am currently the Head of Open Stack Collections, at Arizona State University Library. Prior to that I was the Government Information Librarian & Data Services Librarian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and before that I was the Government Documents Librarian at the University of Akron. 

I am an active member of the [PEGI Project](https://www.pegiproject.org/) steering committee. I am also a past chair of the Depository Library Council, the advisory body for the Federal Depository Library Program, and have recently served as chair of the Government Documents Round Table of the American Library Association. 

This site is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the minimalist theme [Lagrange](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/ "Lagrange, a minimalist Jekyll theme"), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I relied almost entirely on the [Programming Historian tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages "Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages") by Amanda Visconti for assembling and modifying this site.
