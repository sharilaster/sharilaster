Earlier this month, I gave a talk for the Librarians Association of the University of California, Santa Barbara (LAUC-SB) that outlines some of the major events of the last six months.

I'm posting the slides (well, most of the slides) for those who may be interested in the process and current status of Title 44 reform.
