Earlier this month, I gave a talk for the Librarians Association of the University of California, Santa Barbara (LAUC-SB) that outlines some of the major events of the last six months.

Today I'm sharing the [slides (PDF, 3.5MB)](../images/title_44_reform_redacted.pdf) (well, most of the slides) for those who may be interested in this process and the current status of Title 44 reform.
