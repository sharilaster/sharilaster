Today’s lunchtime listen is FGI’s first podcast(!), a [conversation recorded on July 25, 2016, with James A. Jacobs, James R. Jacobs, and Shari Laster](https://archive.org/details/FGICollaborativeFDLP) discussing “[Building a Collaborative FDLP](http://freegovinfo.info/node/11094).” If you missed that post, here’s an excerpt:

> FDLP libraries can work together to provide, *collectively*, more than GPO — or any one library — can provide on its own. A collaborative FDLP is not one mega-library with one huge collection of only those documents that GPO can get. A collaborative FDLP consists of *many* curated collections that include Title 44 content, fugitive content (which GPO cannot force agencies to deposit), and non-Title-44 content that is out of GPO’s scope (e.g., FOIA’d documents, state/local/international government information, non-government information etc.). And each curated collection will have accompanying services tailored to that content for a community of users.
>
> In such a collective approach, every community has access to the content and services it needs and every library provides a small slice of all those customized collections and services. In this approach, each library’s local-institutional community benefits from the contributions of every library.
>
> This approach requires libraries to make one big change in the way they think of “communities.” In this approach, a “community” is a group of people who have common information needs — they need not live and work near any particular library or even near each other. In this approach every library focuses on one or more Designated Communities.[1](http://freegovinfo.info/node/11094#fn:1) In this approach every *institution* benefits from the *collective* work of all FDLP libraries rather than the individual work of only its own local-institutional library.
>
> This approach will result in an FDLP collection that is more complete than GPO can build and maintain on its own and more comprehensive than Title 44; it will have much better functionality, and it will be more secure for the long-term.
