In March 2018, H.R. 5305 was introduced in Congress. The FDLP Modernization Act of 2018 would make changes to the Federal Depository Library Program and other GPO public access programs. As part of a GODORT virtual meeting about the bill, I gave a talk on its provisions. [slides (PDF, 1.3MB)](https://github.com/sharilaster/sharilaster/blob/master/images/HR%205305.pdf) 

I'm grateful to Gavin Baker at ALA Washington Office for many hours of discussion and detailed email exchanges over the months it took for Congress to go from hearings, to draft text, to an introduced bill. I never thought I'd know so much about the legislative process -- and how much more there is to learn.
