Building on a talk given by Jim O'Donnell at the 2017 Charleston Conference, Lorrie McAllister and I expanded on some of the conceptual underpinnings of the "Future of Print" project at ASU Library.

Abstract:

> Arizona State University is embracing new ways of thinking about how open stacks can make books active objects of engagement for a new generation of students, rather than risk becoming mere backdrops for study spaces. By taking a deliberate design approach to answering the question of “which books, where?,” ASU Library seeks to position print collections as an engagement mechanism. This chapter presents the transformative potential of open stacks, along with planning for access, assessment, and inclusive engagement. The authors describe how ASU Library is using a major library renovation project as a catalyst to explore these ideas, and propose a pathway to developing shared solutions for more effective use of library collections.
